# Challenges of Defining a Project Scope in MedTech
Poor project alignment and scope creep are the two top causes of project failure according to the Project Management Institute (PMI). Further, 5 of the top 6 reasons that projects fail, per a 2018 survey also conducted by PMI, are related to the project scope. 

In the realm of medical device development, defining the project scope plays a pivotal role in achieving successful outcomes. This becomes even more critical when working with hybrid teams comprised of internal engineering staff and Contract Development and Manufacturing Organizations (CDMOs). The project scope acts as a guiding framework, enforcing *Power Skills* that will help prevent project creep, budget losses and increase the chance of project success.

*Power Skills* is a term coined by PMI to describe the following four skills that help organizations fulfill objectives:
1.	Communication
2.	Problem-solving
3.	Collaborative Learning
4.	Strategic Thinking

Earlier this year they reported that organizations that prioritize Power Skills experience 12% less project creep and 8% less budget loss. Having a well-defined project scope that includes the requirements, constraints, assumptions, communication channels and deliverables, among other parts of the project scope that may be unique to you.

This two-part article will delve into the challenges of creating projects scopes in the MedTech industries and highlights the vital importance of project scope definition in such contexts.

## The Challenges

Some of the biggest challenges that medical device manufacturers face when putting together a project scope revolve around navigating through complex regulatory systems, ever changing markets, and complex resource management. By laying out the biggest challenges that we have seen in projects that we have led or guided customers through, we hope to encourage project managers and planners to face them head on and develop a detailed project scope early in your product development process in order to reinforce Power Skills.

1.	A Complex and Evolving Regulatory Landscape:
Medical devices are subject to stringent regulations imposed by health authorities worldwide. As new information, devices and novel use cases are introduced to these health authorities it becomes evident that todayâ€™s regulations must evolve to continue to keep end users safe. This means that the regulations that your team navigated five years ago may not be the same as the ones that you will have to navigate today. An additional complication to the regulatory landscape is that health authorities want to make sure that the regulations are not too severe as to impede innovation of brand-new technologies. This usually results in regulations that are not cut and dry. It is not uncommon that teams must develop and justify their own standards in collaboration with health authorities, as part of a PMA, to prove the safety of a new technology. With a continuously changing and often foggy regulatory landscape, project scopes are often shifted in order to maintain compliance with health authorities worldwide.

2.	Technology Advancements & Uncertainties: 
Several industries that the medical device manufacturers heavily rely on advance at a rapid pace. Whether its software, material science, material processing, machining or additive manufacturing, there is always something new to try. Incorporating cutting-edge technologies into medical device projects can be challenging due to limited understanding of their full potential and associated risks. A good project scope will define the balance of innovation and risk mitigation and identify the boundaries of technological feasibility and establish contingency plans for potential roadblocks.

3.	Stakeholder Alignment:
Medical device projects involve diverse stakeholders, including (but definitely not limited to) investors, key opinion leaders, clinicians, engineers, regulatory experts, marketing teams, and end-users. Aligning the expectations, needs, and perspectives of these stakeholders is a complex task. Each stakeholder may have different priorities and objectives, leading to conflicting scope requirements.

4.	Complex Resource Management:
Resource management for medical device projects is often more complex than that of other industries for several reasons. Difficult to predictable market adoption, constantly changing marketization strategy, due to new feasibility, pre-clinical and clinical studies, and a small network of specialty suppliers are some of the biggest complications. Because of these complications, resources like budget, time, labor and expertise are difficult to balance and predict. 

We have seen each of these major challenges keep project managers from producing a project scope to kick-off projects. This leads to confusion between members of a hybrid team and wastes time as issues that are usually addressed in the project scope are hashed out at length. In order to keep projects running smoothly and efficiently make sure that your team is provided with a clear project scope as early as possible. Keep in mind that each of the described challenges will rear its head however, letting them discourage your from producing a project scope will only be detrimental to your team.

Part 2 of this article will be our next newsletter. In our next newsletter, we will shed some light on how teams can best keep each of these challenges in check.
