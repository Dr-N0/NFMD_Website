The success of every design is often dependent on how its made. In order to ensure repeatablity, quality and strength, manufacturing processes must be developed just as designs are. We have extensive experience developing the following processes for various implantable devices:
    
    - Device Assembly
    - Reflow & Lamination
    - Adhesive Bonding Processes
    - Low Volume Injection Molding and Transfer Molding
    - Polymer Tube Preparation and Modification
    - RF Tipping
