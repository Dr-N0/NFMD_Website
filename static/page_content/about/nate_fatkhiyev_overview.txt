As a medical device engineer with a love for adventure, I bring a unique perspective to designing innovative solutions. When I'm not developing medical devices, you can often find me exploring the great outdoors. My passion for adventure translates into my work as I approach each project with a willingness to take risks and try new things.

I am experienced in various aspects of medical device design, development, and manufacturing, including catheter and lead design, custom machine and tooling design, and process development. My skills in mechanical testing procedures, project planning and tracking, and cleanroom process development have helped me excel in fast-paced environments. I am committed to creating quality solutions that meet the unique needs of my clients.
